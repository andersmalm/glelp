Completly changed it to only handle the glcorearb stuff

In the generator folder there is a ruby script called coregen.rb.
This script have, together with glelp/internals/glcorearb.h created
the two files glelp_glcorearb.cpp and glelp_glcorearb.h.
The script is kind of useless since it will only regenerate those files.

SIMPLE INSTRUCTIONS

Just add the files in glelp/internals and glelp.cpp and glelp.h to your
project. In your project, just include glelp.h instead of <gl/gl.h> and
you are on your way!

To do something with this, just:

	// read version and download all the extensions you will need
	if(!glelp::initExtensionLoader())
		return;

	// Here, load everything needed for a OpenGL 4.4 context if possible.
	if(!glelp::init_4_4())
		return;

	// Clear up internal data, don't try to load more extensions now!
	glelp::closeExtensionLoader();

	// If you managed to get here you have all the GL 4.4 things available!
