GLELP ( OpenGL Extensions Helper )

What?
This is a small tool for helping loading GL core arb versions and extensions.

How?
It scans the folder you want to, and all the sub folders, and goes through all the source files.
If it finds any gl calls, it will make sure that the extension get loaded.
It will ignore all comments.

If you have the binary, just run "glelp.exe -dir <dir with shaders>"

Include glelp.cpp and glelp.h to your project and call glelp::loadExtensions().
If all wen't well you get a true back.

If you need to update to get new extensions, download the latest glcorearb.h from
Khronos, and run "glelp.exe -init" to generate new extension files.

Disclaimer:
Seems to work, but I haven't tried on all the code in the world
